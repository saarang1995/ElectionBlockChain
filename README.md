# Electing candidates by building the smart contract using Truffle Framework (Etherium Blockchain)  

Candidate election business logic written in Solidity. Running on Blockchain as a smart contract. 

Technologies and setup steps:

1. install truffle
-> npm install -g truffle.

(Gives us suite of tools for writing smart contracts in solidity language)

2. install ganache
-> from truffleframework.com

(Local in memory blackchain for development purposes)

3. Add 'metamask' extension to the chrome browser.
-> from metamask.io

(Will allow us to connect to the blockchain network)

4. Add Solidity language package in the code Editor: Visual Studio code.


# Note
For cleaner project repository I have excluded node_modules. Please run "npm install" when you download the Electionblockchain project.


# Tests

Running tests for checking if the blockchain is bug free, this is required because bugs will cost a fortune to the clients as they pay ethers for usage.

The tests are the simulation of the client side interaction hence written in Javascript.
(Truffle comes with Mocha and Chai as a testing frameworks).

Both the frameworks are used in the election.js file. 
"It" -> from the Mocha
"Assert" -> from the Chai

Process: create a election.js file in a test directory -> command touch test/election.js
Once done -> run truffle test
Below should be the result (If Successful):
 
 _Contract: Election
  _  âœ“ instialized with 2 candidates
  _1 passing (61ms)
